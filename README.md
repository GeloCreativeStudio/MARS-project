MARS
<sup>Multifunctional AI Responsive System</sup>

MARS is an innovative AI project developed by researchers at EMA EMITS College Philippines. It harnesses the power of the Flask Python framework and the state-of-the-art GPT-3.5-turbo language model. The primary objective of MARS is to seamlessly integrate Text-to-Speech (TTS), Speech-to-Text (STT), and the world's most advanced Language Model (LLM), thereby providing a highly functional and intelligent voice AI assistant.

MARS is currently in its developmental phase, with continuous efforts being made to enhance its capabilities and performance. The researchers are actively working on improving the integration of various components, refining the user experience, and expanding the functionality of the system.
