# MARS - Multifunctional AI Responsive System

MARS is an innovative AI project developed by researchers at EMA EMITS College Philippines. It harnesses the power of the Flask Python framework and the cutting-edge GPT-3.5-turbo language model. The primary objective of MARS is to seamlessly integrate Text-to-Speech (TTS), Speech-to-Text (STT), and the world's most advanced Language Model (LLM), providing a highly functional voice AI assistant.

**Note: MARS is currently in its developmental phase, with continuous efforts being made toward its enhancement.**
