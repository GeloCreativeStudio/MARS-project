<sup>Multifunctional AI Responsive System</sup>

MARS, an innovative AI project from the researchers of EMA EMITS College Philippines, harnesses the power of the Flask Python framework and the cutting-edge GPT-3.5-turbo. Its primary objective is to seamlessly integrate Text-to-Speech (TTS), Speech-to-Text (STT), and the world’s most advanced Language Model (LLM), thereby providing a highly functional voice AI assistant. Currently, MARS is in its developmental phase, with continuous efforts being made towards its enhancement.
