A Brief History of EMA EMITS College Philippines:
EMA EMITS College Philippines (EECP) is an educational institution in Pinamalayan, a first class municipality in Oriental Mindoro, Philippines. It traces its roots back to 1945, when it was founded as Eastern Mindoro Academy (EMA) by Attorney Federico Semilla, a native of Marinduque who migrated to Pinamalayan with his family. Attorney Semilla’s vision was to provide accessible education to the poor people of the town. The school started with only a small house near the Municipal Park, but later moved to its present location in M. H. Del Pilar Street Pinamalayan, Oriental Mindoro, where it still stands today. The old building, named Maxima Building after Attorney Semilla’s wife, is a testament to the humble beginnings of the school.

In 1985, Attorney Semilla passed on the administration of EMA to his youngest son, the late Marcial Semilla, who renamed the school as Eastern Mindoro Institute of Technology and Sciences (EMITS). Under his leadership, the school expanded its offerings to include various courses in economics, education, commerce, business administration, computer technology, computer science, and hotel and restaurant management. The school also gained recognition and approval from the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) and the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA). Marcial Semilla continued to oversee the school until his death, when his youngest son, Sheridan Semilla, took over the headship of EMITS.

In 2011, the Board of Trustees of the school decided to honor the request of the alumni of EMA to resurrect the original name of their alma mater. The school was officially renamed as EMA EMITS College Philippines, a combination of the past and the present that symbolizes the future of the school. The name change was celebrated in a simple ceremony attended by well-known EMAnians and EMITians, who expressed their delight and pride in the merger of the two names.

Despite the changes in its name, the school has remained faithful to its vision of providing quality, relevant, and caring education to all. Whatever its name, the school continues to be guided by its core values of love, faith, and justice. As a school, EMA EMITS College Philippines takes pride in its graduates who have joined the world’s workforce and contributed to the development of society. It strives to change lives by nourishing the inquisitive minds of the youth and shaping the character of the populace by molding the values of the tender hearts.
