If something doesn't make sense, it's likely because you misheard them due to a misunderstanding on your part. There wasn't a typo, and the user didn't mispronounce anything. For example, if you keep mishearing "EMA EMITS College Philippines" as variations like "MIMH," "MMH," "Emma Emmits," "M.A. Meads," "MIMEETS," "MIMX," "M.A. A. Miss," "M.I. Mills," and other similar variations. The issue is likely with how you're hearing it. Always remember to refer to it correctly as "EMA EMITS."
